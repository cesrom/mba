This script is designed to take two arguments, [message, level], 
for the Ignition Logging engine. The `message` parameter is the 
payload published to the MES logger, and `level` represents the 
severity of the log. Supported log levels are:

- fatal
- error
- warn
- info
- debug
- trace
'''

def log(message, level):
    import system
    
    # Initialize the logger for the MES system
    logger = system.util.getLogger('MES')
    
    # Map the level argument to the corresponding log level
    if level.lower() == 'info':
        logger.info(message)
    elif level.lower() == 'fatal':
        logger.fatal(message)
    elif level.lower() == 'error':
        logger.error(message)
    elif level.lower() == 'warn':
        logger.warn(message)
    elif level.lower() == 'debug':
        logger.debug(message)
    elif level.lower() == 'trace':
        logger.trace(message)
    else:
