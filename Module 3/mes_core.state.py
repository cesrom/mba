Description:
This module provides functionality for managing state history within the MES Core database.
It includes functions to handle updates and insertions into the `statehistory` table based
on changes in state reasons and associated line identifiers.

Functions:
    - storeStateHistory: Updates the end time for the previous state history entry and 
      inserts a new entry for the current state based on the provided reasonCode and lineID.

"""

#default database name
db = 'mes_core'

def storeStateHistory(reasonCode, lineID, db=db):
    '''
    This function takes two arguments from the tag event -- the reasonCode and the lineID. 
    When called from the tag event, this function will fill in the end time of the previous 
    state history entry and create a new entry for the current state.

    Parameters:
        reasonCode (int): The code for the reason of the state change.
        lineID (int): The ID of the line associated with the state change.
        db (str): The database name to use for the query. Defaults to 'mes_core'.

    Returns:
        None
